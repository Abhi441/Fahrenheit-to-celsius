# Fahrenheit-to-celsius

Formula to convert an number n in Fahrenheit to Celsius is : (5 / 9) * (n - 32).
This problem is quite easy for everyone, but still this question has a important point to ponder.viz, Obviously you all are taking int datatype to store the number n whose conversion is to found.
About that, when you are putting n in the formula and calculating the answer you will get 0 as the ans.
That's because 5 / 9 is zero as 5 is int by default and 9 is also int by default so when you divide an int by an int you get an int and 5 / 9 is 0.555 in terms of decimal but 0 in int.
So you need to convert the either 5 or 9 to float so that when you divide a float by an int you would get a float viz, 0.55 instead of 0.
But now the number become float so you need to convert it into int by type casting.
Finally the Formula becomes: (int)((5.0/9) * (n - 32)).

import java.util.*;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int Min = sc.nextInt();
		int Max = sc.nextInt();
		int step = sc.nextInt();
		for(int f = Min ; f <= Max ; f = f + step)
		{
			int c =(int)((5.0/9) * (f - 32));
			System.out.print(f +"\t");
			System.out.print(c);
			System.out.println();
			
		}
			
		
    }
}
